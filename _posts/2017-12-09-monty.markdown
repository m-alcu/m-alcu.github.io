> Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle: You are in a game show, and in front of you are three doors: Behind one of them there is a car and behind the others goats. You pick a door (1 or 2 or 3) and the hosts, who knows what's behind doors, opens another door, that has a goat behind. Then asks you: "Do you keep to choose the same door?", it is your advantage to switch your door?

This could be one of the intuitive ways to determinte every case and compute the sum of each result:

**door** : initial door picked  
**car** : door where the car is hiden  
**switch** : action to switch 0=Stick 1=Change  
**result** : result of the game 0=goat 1=car  

| door     | car | switch | result |
|:--------:|:---:|:------:|:------:|
| 1        | 1   | 0      | 1      |
| 1        | 1   | 1      | 0      |
| 1        | 2   | 0      | 0      |
| 1        | 2   | 1      | 1      |
| 1        | 3   | 0      | 0      |
| 1        | 3   | 1      | 1      |
| 2        | 2   | 0      | 1      |
| 2        | 2   | 1      | 0      |
| 2        | 3   | 0      | 0      |
| 2        | 3   | 1      | 1      |
| 2        | 1   | 0      | 0      |
| 2        | 1   | 1      | 1      |
| 3        | 3   | 0      | 1      |
| 3        | 3   | 1      | 0      |
| 3        | 1   | 0      | 0      |
| 3        | 1   | 1      | 1      |
| 3        | 2   | 0      | 0      |
| 3        | 2   | 1      | 1      |

 $$ \text{total cases}  = {18}.$$  
 $$ \text{total cases with car result}  = {9}.$$  
 $$ \text{total cases that stick with car result}  = {3}.$$  
 $$ \text{total cases that change with car result}  = {6}.$$  
 $$ \text{car probability that stick}  = {3 \over 9}.$$  
 $$ \text{car probability that change}  = {6 \over 9}.$$  

 There is a formal view to calculate the result with bayes theorem:

$$P(A|B)  = {P(B|A)*P(A) \over P(B)}.$$

There is a more accurate form if you consider that the sum:

$$\sum_{i=1}^N{P(A_i)}=1$$

$$P(A_k|B)  = {P(B|A_k)*P(A_k) \over \sum_{i=1}^N{P(B|A_i)*P(A_i)}}.$$

In our case let's assume we choose door #1 
**C** = where the car really is hidden

$$P(C=1) = P(C=2) = P(C=3) = {1 \over 3}$$
