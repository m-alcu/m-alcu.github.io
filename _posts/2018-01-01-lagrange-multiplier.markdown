> Lagrange multiplier is a mathematical optimization to obtain local maxima and minima subject to constraints, that is needed to understand regulatization L1 and L2.

maximize f(x,y)
subject to g(x,y) = 0

f, g are continuous first partial derivatives

$$\mathcal{L}(x,y,\lambda) = f(x,y) - \lambda g(x,y)$$
